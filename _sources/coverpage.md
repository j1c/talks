# Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Here you will find a collection of talks I have given. All the talks available here is based on [Marp](https://marp.app) that converts markdown to slides in pdf or html.

Some of the past talks are not available here because they were given as powerpoint slides or in other offline formats. They will be uploaded once they are converted to the markdown MARP format.
