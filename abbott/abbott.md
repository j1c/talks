# Slide 1: Introduction to Connectomic Heritability

Definition of connectomics: study of the brain's neural connections, known as the connectome
Importance of the connectome in understanding brain function and disorders
Definition of heritability: proportion of variation in a trait that can be attributed to genetic factors
Introduce the concept of connectomic heritability: investigating the extent to which genetic factors influence the organization of the connectome

---

# Slide 2: Key Findings and Implications

Studies showing that genetic factors play a significant role in shaping the connectome
Twin studies
Genome-wide association studies (GWAS)

Connectomic heritability and its relationship with cognitive traits and mental disorders
Autism spectrum disorder
Schizophrenia
Alzheimer's disease

Future research directions and potential applications
Personalized medicine
Early diagnosis and intervention
Improved understanding of brain function and development
